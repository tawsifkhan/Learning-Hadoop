# Learning-Hadoop

I started with the Udacity [Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-hadoop-and-mapreduce--ud617) online course. I would recommend this course to anyone who is willing to get started with Hadoop.

I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcjSe0xCHbE) pretty useful and unique to understand the objectives of the Mappers and Reducers in a Hadoop job.

This repository will be updated with the mapreduce codes I have written for the mini projects. My goal in maintaining this repository will be to keep a track of what I have done and also help anyone to get started with Hadoop. 

#### Task 1

    Objective - Compute the number of hits on every file.
